PyMMPZ is a Python library and scripts for converting .mmpz files to midi.
It's a pretty minimal set of functions as-is, and could possibly benefit from a
redesign, with a more object-oriented API, so it can be used for more than just
.mmpz to midi conversion.

PyMMPZ is partially based on the MIDIUtil project by Mark Conway Wirt:
